And then, a shot fired. But first, let's go back 3 hours. It was a sunny day in Idaho and Cowboy Rick was enjoying
a great cup of joe. Cowboy rick was minding his own business when there was a knock at the door. "Who could that be" thought Cowboy Rick.
When Cowboy Rick opened the door, he was shocked as to who he saw. He wasn't expecting to see this person ever again.
The very person he saw was his arch rival that he thought he had killed years ago. This mans name was Larry. 
Larry, a gritty cowboy himself cmae for nothing but vengance. And vengance he would get.
In fact, Larry was so intent on vengeance for Rick's not having killed him, that Larry was pointing a gun at Cowboy Rick even as he opened the door!
Rick was, naturally, flabbergasted.
But Rick knowing that larry would fire, was determined to not go down without a fight. They both drew their guns fast. A lound bang and some smoke. A red pool of blood was at one side, but nothing else. Who was shot? To this day no one knows.
